## Overview
ChemNose is an arduino based gas detection and chemical reaction observation platform. It is designed to be a low cost, portable, and easy to use platform for detecting gases and observing chemical reactions. The platform is built around an Arduino Uno and uses a variety of sensors to detect gases and observe chemical reactions. The platform is designed to be modular and expandable, allowing users to add additional sensors and modules as needed.
It was primarily designed for and used in simulated Mars and Moon exploration science missions for the Anatolian Rover Challenge 2024 by UludaÄŸ University Rover Team (ULUROVER).
Their science team, under my leadership had a hypothesis investigating the habitability of Mars and Moon for Methanogenic Microorganisms. With this in mind, I designed the platform and data analysis pipeline to fit this task.

## Materials And Methods

The platform was built to mainly investigate the habitability of Mars for Methanogenic Microorganisms alongside other chemical assays that are beyond the scope of this document. The main simplified assumption of how a methanogenic microorganisms produce methane is outlined in the diagram below:

The presence of and changes in the concentrations in ppm of the gases CO2, CH4 and H2 were measured using the MQ-135, MQ-4 and MQ-8 gas sensors respectively. The test for the presence of the other ions necessary for cofactors was done using ion specific chemicals assays.  

The general form of the platform 's pipeline is shown in the diagram below:

<img src="Images/Diagrams/Pipe.png" alt="Pipeline Diagram" title="Platform Pipeline Diagram" width="350"/>

The platform consists of 4 modules:
- The Weather Station Module
- The Gas Detection Module with no SD card functionality
- The Gas Detection Module with SD card functionality
- The Soil Moisture Module

### The Weather Station Module

This is the main module that was designed to be run independent of a direct computer connection of the arduino uno. It's main purpose is to measure the temperature, humidity, CH4, CO2 and H2 concentration in the air during the Rover's missions. The data is stored in a SD card for later analysis as a timestamped CSV file in the %m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S format. Readings are taken every 2 seconds to reduce error of the sensors for the output of a high quality dataset. 
The circuit diagram for the weather station module is shown below:

<img src="Images/Circuits/Weather Station.png" alt="Weather Station Circuit Diagram" title="Weather Station Circuit Diagram" width="350"/>

It consists fo the following sensors:
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- MQ-135 Gas Sensor
- MQ-4 Gas Sensor
- MQ-8 Gas Sensor
- DS3231 RTC Module
- SD Card Module

#### The Weather Station Module Carrying Case

A 3D printable carrying case for the module was designed for easy mounting on the rover. It is a modular 3 piece design that can be easily assembled and disassembled. The design files for the carrying case can be found in the [`Weatherbox 3D Printable`](Weatherbox 3D Printable) folder.The overall schematics for the carrying case is shown below:

Placement of the circuit components in the case is shown below:

_(note, batteries are to be placed in two 4 AA battery holders that go into the bottom section of the case not side by side as the diagram depicts)_

The sensors will sit int the designated slots in the top of the case similar to the image shown below:

- MQ-8 Gas Sensor
- SD Card Module(Optional)

A novel 350ml closed gas chamber was designed and made using an airtight plastic container with holes to tightly fit the gas sensors. This allows for greater accuracy of the gs measurements. The chamber is setup is shown below:

### The Soil Moisture Module

For measurement and classification of soil sample humidity in the lab setting, another module was designed using an arduino uno and a soil moisture sensor. **_This setup requires no specialized housing and does not return a CSV output for analysis_**. The circuit diagram for the soil moisture module is shown below: 

<img src="Images/Circuits/SoilMoistureSensor.png" alt="Weather Station Circuit Diagram" title="Weather Station Circuit Diagram" width="350"/>

## Data Analysis Pipeline

### Weather Station Data Analysis

**Step 1: Data Collection**  
Setup the Weather Station Module and run the [Arduino_code/weatherStationNoUv/weatherStationNoUv.ino](Arduino_code/weatherStationNoUv/weatherStationNoUv.ino) Arduino sketch on the Arduino Uno. The data will be stored in a CSV file on the SD card in a name of your choosing.

**Step 2: Data Analysis**  
Retrieve the CSV file from the SD card and move it into the repository folder called [Sensor_data](Sensor_data). The data titled `DAY1.csv` and `DAY2.csv` is an example of the data that will be collected.  
Boxplot alongside summary statistics and Line plots of the metrics can be obtained by using the [R_code/day2Boxes.R](R_code/day2Boxes.R) and [R_code/day2Lines.R](R_code/day2Lines.R) scripts.

They generate plots like the ones shown below:
