## Overview
ChemNose is an arduino based gas detection and chemical reaction observation platform. It is designed to be a low cost, portable, and easy to use platform for detecting gases and observing chemical reactions. The platform is built around an Arduino Uno and uses a variety of sensors to detect gases and observe chemical reactions. The platform is designed to be modular and expandable, allowing users to add additional sensors and modules as needed.
It was primarily designed for and used in simulated Mars and Moon exploration science missions for the Anatolian Rover Challenge 2024 by UludaÄŸ University Rover Team (ULUROVER).
Their science team, under my leadership had a hypothesis investigating the habitability of Mars and Moon for Methanogenic bacteria. With this in mind, I designed the platform and data analysis pipeline to fit this task.



## Future Directions For the Project
- Add a VEML6070 UV Sensor to the Weather Station to measure UV Index.
- Add a BME280 Sensor to the Weather Station for more accurate temperature and humidity readings as well as barometric pressure readings.
- Automate the data analysis process with a bash script.
- Add a pipeline explanatory diagram to the README.md file.
